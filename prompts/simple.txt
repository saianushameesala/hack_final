# Simple ML Explanation Template

This model works by {model_type} to predict {target_description}. 

The most important features are:
{top_features}

When making predictions, the model considers these features in order of importance and combines them to produce the final output.

To interpret the results:
- Higher values of {positive_features} are associated with higher predictions
- Higher values of {negative_features} are associated with lower predictions

If you want to understand specific predictions, I can provide SHAP or LIME explanations for individual instances.
