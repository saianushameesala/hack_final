## Interpretation Guide
When interpreting this model's predictions:

1. **Positive Drivers**: {positive_features_explained}
   These features tend to increase the predicted value/probability.

2. **Negative Drivers**: {negative_features_explained}
   These features tend to decrease the predicted value/probability.

3. **Feature Interactions**: {feature_interactions}
   Some features have important interactions that affect predictions.

## Recommendations for Analysis
- Use SHAP values to understand how features contribute to individual predictions
- LIME explanations can provide local approximations that are more interpretable
- Consider how feature values compare to the dataset distribution when interpreting importance
